Interest rates on the new bond, issued in 2008, are linked to Libor, so CPS no longer has to worry about bond rates and swap rates moving in opposite directions. But because of the economic downturn, the new rates, while more predictable, are painfully high: 100 percent of Libor. The swap rate, meanwhile, remains at 70 percent of Libor. Every time Libor rises, as it did in October 2008, CPS must pay more to cover that gap.
